What are Commands?
Used to control your world or talk to players
Commands are features you can use to control your world and the entities within. These Commands are very useful for when you want to test things out or want to make the game easier. However, we don't recommend using Commands while playing in Survival Mode, as these will trivialize the game and upset the game balance.

How to Use Commands
Turn on Cheats in your world
Minecraft - turn Cheats on

To use Commands, you have to turn on Cheats in your world first. Commands are available for both Java and Bedrock editions, though some Commands are exclusive to an edition.

Enter the command in the chat window
Minecraft - open chat window

Open your chat window by pressing T or / (forward slash) for PC players or by pressing D-pad right for Console players. Input your Command and press the Enter key to activate it.

Commands are easier to use with the 1.13 version
Minecraft - entering Commands

With the 1.13 update for the PC version, a short list of Commands will be displayed immediately after typing /. Valid arguments (or values) will also be shown as you type a Command that can also be selected quickly by pressing the TAB key.

Enter Commands using Command Blocks
Minecraft - Command Blocks

You can also use Command Blocks to handle more complex Commands! You can give your character Command Blocks by typing /give @p command_block. Place the Command Block and use it to customize the Command it executes.

Command Blocks are activated using Redstone signals emitted by objects like buttons or pressure plates.
