Obtaining
TNT can be broken instantly with any tool, or without a tool. However, primed TNT cannot be broken, as it is an entity, but it can be removed with the /kill command.

Chest loot

Natural generation
Nine TNT blocks occur naturally in each desert pyramid trap.

Two TNT blocks flank a trapped chest in one secret woodland mansion room.

Usage

A TNT explosion.

TNT blocks can be activated by:

using a flint and steel or a fire charge
using any item enchanted with Fire Aspect‌[Bedrock Edition only]
using a Fire Aspect Enchanted Book‌[Bedrock Edition only]
a powered redstone current
being shot by a flaming projectile
being shot with an arrow from a bow with flame enchantment.
being shot with an arrow through lava or fire
being hit by a ghast or blaze fireballs.
being hit by a fire charge fired from a dispenser
coming into contact with spreading fire or lava
being in the blast radius of a nearby explosion, including that of another TNT block, a Creeper, a bed, a respawn anchor or an end crystal.
being summoned, in which case detonates immediately‌[Java Edition only] (this can be changed with the Fuse tag)
being fired from a dispenser
being lit by a flint and steel used by a dispenser
being hit by an explosive skull from a Wither
being hit by a lightning bolt.
Behavior
Primed TNT
TNT.png
Once activated, TNT turns into an entity, which includes being affected by gravity. The new primed TNT is spawned at the center (+0.5,+0.5,+0.5) of where the TNT block was, like a cube with an edge length of 0.98. Its fuse lasts 40 redstone ticks (4 seconds/80 game ticks) if activated by redstone or fire, or a random number between 10 and 30 game ticks (0.5 to 1.5 seconds) if it is destroyed by another explosion.

Once spawned, primed TNT is given a vertical velocity of 0.2 blocks per tick, and a horizontal velocity of 0.02 blocks per tick in a random direction. Given these velocities, the TNT travels 0.166 blocks (or 6 block pixels) horizontally before it stops, given there is no block in the way. When the countdown timer expires, the TNT explodes. If in the air, TNT falls roughly 77 blocks before exploding once it is ignited. The explosion has an explosive force of 4.

Primed TNT's texture blinks, alternating every 0.5 seconds between the TNT block's texture, and a copy of it that has been brightened to near-white. The effect is dynamic and the brightened texture can't be found in the assets.

Primed TNT cannot be pushed by players or other mobs, but it moves when in flowing water or lava. Water/lava cannot push primed TNT into minecarts or boats.

When primed TNT detonates while in water or lava, it does not break any blocks. It does still damage players, mobs, and other entities.‌[Java Edition only][1] Primed TNT that detonates outside water can still damage submerged blocks.

To make TNT destroy blocks in the water, e.g. to enter an ocean monument from the top, one can place sand or gravel on the TNT before it is primed. Priming the TNT causes the sand or gravel to fall one block, engulfing the TNT. Because the TNT is no longer immersed in water, it can destroy the surrounding blocks.

Primed TNT is not teleported when entering a nether portal; instead, it passes through portal blocks.‌[Java Edition only] Primed TNT teleports as expected when entering an end portal, maintaining its direction and speed. The fuse timer keeps counting down (unless the spawn chunks are unloaded, then it pauses until a player loads the chunks).

If the TNT is primed atop any sort of fence post that is two blocks high or larger, it falls through the fence block on which it was activated and stops on the next lower one. Its detonation damages only the fence block it was "stuck" in.

In Java Edition primed TNT summoned by a command explodes immediately because the fuse time defaults to zero if not specified.

Redstone component
For redstone to activate TNT, it must either lead directly to the TNT, or power an adjacent block.

Traps
See also: Tutorials/Traps
TNT can be used in a variety of traps. The simplest of them – a land mine – is made of TNT connected to a pressure plate or tripwire with redstone. One such trap generates naturally in desert pyramids under the loot area.

Cannons
See also: Tutorials/TNT cannons
TNT cannons are mechanisms that launch primed TNT into the air. Some cannons can also be used to launch other entities or objects into the air.

Mob farm
See also: Tutorials/Mob farm
Mobs killed by player-ignited TNT (via flint and steel or by flaming arrows) drop experience orbs as though they were killed by the player in regular combat.

    This article documents an April Fools' joke. 
    This feature was exclusively part of a joke version and is not currently planned for addition to regular Minecraft.
    It is documented here on the wiki due to being officially-released content by Mojang Studios, even if not present in a final version.

        Etho slabs behave like TNT although there is a 25 % chance to spawn a falling anvil one block above the nearest player up to 20 blocks away.
        Data values
        Blocks with data value 1 are called "Etho Slab (Lit??)" and explode on punch.
